This is an Android app made for Swipe Interview screening, It consists of two screens - a product listing screen and an add product screen. The app allows users to view a list of products, search for products, and add new products to the list. It follows the MVVM architecture, utilizes Retrofit for REST API calls, KOIN for Dependency Injection, and Lifecycle for Kotlin coroutines. Additionally, the app implements Navigation Component from Jetpack to navigate between fragments.

## Technologies Used

The app leverages modern technologies and follows best practices to ensure efficiency and maintainability. The major tech used in this project are:

- MVVM Architecture: Separating the app into layers of Model, View, and ViewModel to promote a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Retrofit: Handling REST API calls to retrieve and send data to the server.
- KOIN: Managing dependency injection to decouple classes and improve testability.
- Kotlin Coroutines with Lifecycle: Managing background tasks and asynchronous operations efficiently while respecting Android lifecycle.
- Navigation Component: Navigating between fragments in the app seamlessly.
- Sealed Classes: Handling generic responses and providing clear and consistent feedback to users.

## Testing

The app has been thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality and stability in various scenarios and conditions.
